# Smart City - Traffic Simulation

Collaborative effort for HackPompey Hackathon 2018 between @ThomasApter, @Emilymaryon and @Harveyaitken

The event was a 2-day Hackathon in which we could create anything we wanted, one of the topics recommended was Smart Cities.

The project uses a Python backend which runs the vehicle simulation along with an API for the frontend to get Vehicle Locations.

The frontend is Javascript and uses a Canvas to display the map (CSV File) along with updating vehicle locations.
